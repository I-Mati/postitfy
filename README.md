## Technical Overview

For this project, we are using a few well-known libraries for React, such us

- Create React App
- Font Awesome
- React Router

We are also using eslint, with Airbnb configuration.

### Folder Structure

The first technical decision was to divide the files in a common structure, that allows the developers to follow a common and clear pattern.
Inside `src`, there is a `component` folder that has all the component in the next pattern:

```
/components
-/ComponentName
---index.js
---style.css
```

This allows a better way to find the component file and the style at the same place.

### Where is the data?

In this case, this project. is not using Redux or Context, to manage the data this app is using a single array state with objects (the postits) in App.js (main component) and passing them through props.

To handle the changes in this array of postit, there is a function (`handleEditing`) that handles different scenarios based on a string parameter. Inside this function, s switch is used to identify each case, apply the change and make a new array and then, update the state, this function does not mutate the state directly.

### Data persistence

This app is using localStorage to persistent the data introduced by the user, this has clear limitations but is enough to manage data locally on a device.
